# Parallelisation of Classical LBM using OpenACC and Evaluation on 2D Lid driven cavity case. 
This project presents the implementation of a classical Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) in C++ and its parallelization using OpenACC. The LBM solver exhibits significant potential for parallelization, particularly in the collision and streaming steps, which collectively consume around 90% of the total simulation time. To facilitate efficient computation, an abstract data structure is employed to store distribution values at each grid point. The implementation begins with the initialization of velocity, density, and distribution function vectors, followed by the execution of collision, streaming, and boundary condition application steps. The process iterates until a convergence criterion based on the error in velocities within a specified tolerance is met. 

Two main blocks of parallelism are utilized: the first block handles memory allocation for all variables and initialization on the GPU, while the second block operates within a while loop, managing iterations until convergence. It performs streaming and collision step updates on GPU and transfers error values. Upon convergence, the GPU transfers the complete solution to the CPU for further post-processing.
