# Parallelisation of Classical LBM using OpenACC and evaluation on 2D Lid driven cavity test. 
A parallelization approach leveraging OpenACC to enhance the performance of a classical Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) solver. The methodology is validated through simulations of a 2D lid-driven cavity test case.
