# PARALLELISATION OF CLASSICAL LBM USING OPENACC AND EVALUATION ON 2D LID DRIVEN CAVITY TEST
A parallelization approach leveraging OpenACC to enhance the performance of a classical Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) solver. The methodology is validated through simulations of a 2D lid-driven cavity test case.
